### Why *Laika*?

Simple! Dogs are the best companions for humans, and they're great at fetching things.

This project is a tribute to Laika, the first animal put into orbit around Earth, because her story is worth remembering.  Not only is she the first and coolest space dog, but, well, look at that adorable face!
